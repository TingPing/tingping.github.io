This month I was at my second [Libre Application Summit](https://las.gnome.org) in Denver.
A smaller event than GUADEC but personally was my favorite conference so far.

<!--more-->

One of the main goals of LAS has been to be a place for multiple platforms to discuss the desktop space
and not just be a GNOME event. This year two KDE members, @aleixpol and Albert Astals Cid, who spoke about
release cycle of [KDE Applications](https://twitter.com/LASGNOME/status/1038204872678629376), Plasma, and the [history of Qt](https://twitter.com/LASGNOME/status/1038084533206372352).
It is always interesting to see how another project solves the same problems and where there is overlap.

The elementary folks were there since this is @cassidyjames home turf who had a great ["It's Not Always Techincal"](https://twitter.com/LASGNOME/status/1038158404328607744) talk as well as a talk with @danrabbit about [AppCenter](https://twitter.com/LASGNOME/status/1038177696071774208) which are both very important areas the GNOME Project needs to improve
in. I also enjoyed meeting a few other community members such as @Philip-Scott and
talk about their use of elementary's platform.

Heather from Purism spoke about the [Librem 5 status](https://twitter.com/LASGNOME/status/1038536036501086209)
which I'm excited for but has a way to go. It was great to get an opportunity to meet her since we've spoken
online about their interest in Flatpak and GNOME-Builder.

There were some fantastic talks discussing FOSS usage at a broader level:

- ["FreeHive: An Open-Source Creative Agency"](https://twitter.com/LASGNOME/status/1038098083102580739) and ["Developers, Developers, Developers—How About Creatives?"](https://twitter.com/LASGNOME/status/1038163877333266434) - Ryan Gorely
- ["How Can You Make Your Open Source Project Attractive to Students?"](https://twitter.com/LASGNOME/status/1038113840037289984) - Heidi Ellis and Gregory Hislop
- ["Research Science and Libre Computing"](https://twitter.com/LASGNOME/status/1038551786511101953) - Britt Yazel

As always there was a big Flatpak presense and throughout we had the opportunity to discuss things like
[adding Qt to fdo](https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk/issues/356), [tracking runtime CVEs](https://github.com/tingping/flatpak-cve-checker), sandboxing WebKitGTK, etc. We also had a [Flatpak BoF](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/wiki/LAS-GNOME-Flatpak-BoF) on the last day
discussing things like possibilty of selling apps and infrastructure improvements.

I really enjoyed the event overall and look forward to future LASes. Next week I will be in [A Coruña, Spain,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Coru%C3%B1a)
for the [webengine hackfest](https://webengineshackfest.org/2018/).
